    desc: "Snake is a classic arcade game that has been enjoyed by generations of players. The objective of the game is to control a snake, moving it around a playing field, and eating food items to grow longer. As the snake grows, it becomes more challenging to avoid colliding with its own body or the walls of the playing field.In my experience with creating a Snake game, I utilized my programming skills to design and develop a fully functional version of the game. I employed algorithms and data structures to ensure smooth gameplay and an engaging user experience. Additionally, I implemented user-friendly controls, intuitive graphics, and sound effects to enhance the overall aesthetic of the game."
